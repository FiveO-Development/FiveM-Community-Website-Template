                        <h3 class="rule-title">9. Gang War Mechanics</h3>
                        <div class="rule-content">
                            <p>Gang Wars must follow a natural evolution of roleplay. Shallow roleplay may be seen as RDM and thus disciplinary action could follow. In order for war to occur you must come to an agreement of what you are fighting for. War must be a last resort and must not be started because of one person's actions from a gang. Gang leaders can request for peace; however, peace can come at a cost.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>An RP-support ticket must be opened for the initiating gang to get war approval. There must be good enough terms to start a war.</li>
                                <li>Gang wars must be announced before the first attack is started.</li>
                                <li>To start a gang war an in-city parley must happen on neutral grounds to discuss the terms of the war. At this time violence must not occur.</li>
                                <li>After someone is downed for any reason you must sit out the rest of that round.</li>
                                <li>Gang wars must work on an attack-retaliation cycle. One gang attacks, then the other attacks. Last man standing from the round wins.</li>
                                <li>Gang wars must not last longer than 72 hrs.</li>
                                <li>If rules are broken the leaders must go over the issues and the gang with the rule breaks will take the loss for that round. If the war gets toxic or goes federal the war will be stopped and the gang with the highest score wins.</li>
                                <li>If a medic is introduced to the war then at no time must they be shot. A medic will be required to wear all white in an all white vehicle. It will be up to the leaders and their pre-war parley to decide what happens if the medics get shot by the opposing gang. This could be a cease-fire until the medic is back on their feet or the round is lost by the shooting gang. Medics must also wait until the shooting has subsided in that area to move in and start picking up bodies.</li>

                        <div class="rule-content">
                            <p>Something crucial within RP must happen between the two parties in order for a war to happen. A poor reason behind a war can lead to admin intervention.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In most cases the request for peace must be accepted unless there is a very good reason to push for more war.</li>
                                <li>Both sides may introduce allies to join in the war.</li>
                                <li>If allies are brought in it can only be one other gang, not multiple members from other gangs.</li>
                                <li>Gangs can only be in one war at a time. A two-week waiting period must be waited before the initiating can declare war on the same gang again.</li>
                                <li>Gangs must conduct gang wars in their respective colors. Anyone not in Gang colors must either leave and not come back during the scene, or surrender. If they participate in the violence in any way, it will be seen as injecting into the Gang War scene and can be fired upon.</li>
                                <li>If vehicles bearing the color of an attacking/retaliating gang enter a gang turf, it can be pressed and escalated to violence. Do not automatically open fire unless it is very clear that they are there to do violence.</li>
                                <li>All members of your gang can be involved in the war, this does not include hang-arounds. They must be full members of your gang.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <p>All Initiation rules and Violence Escalation apply for both gangs and cops. Violence must be the final step when interacting with cops that inject into a Gang War in progress. Law enforcement will be trained to not shoot on sight, the same rules must be followed by the gangs as well.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>LEO must not interfere in a gang war.</li>
                                <li>EMS will not be required to continually go into a gang area where shootouts are constant.</li>
                                <li>EMS will not be a gang's personal revive bot. Should your character be injured or go down in a gang-on-gang situation, EMS will not come on the scene until the end of the RP. If the RP is in a red zone (trap houses, drug processing, etc.), EMS will not respond.</li>
